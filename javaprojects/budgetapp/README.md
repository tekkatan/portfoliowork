## [BudgetApp](https://github.com/tekkatan/portfoliowork/tree/main/javaprojects/budgetapp "goto java BudgetApp project")

### Info
- The BudgetApp is a CRUD App made with Java OpenJDK 8 and the Swing library
- This App is made as a moduleassingment of module Designing and Programming (Ontwerpen en Programmeren) for my
  education HBO Software Development.
- To prevent any copyright issues, the supermarketnames have been changed to 
  supermarktnaam 01, 02, etc in this online version.

### Usage - Creating and adding articles
- The User starts at the screen below where he/she can fill in the fields.
![StartScreen - BudgetApp](javaprojects/budgetapp/startscreenBudgetApp.png "StartScreen - BudgetApp")

- The program will inform the User about any errors like in the examples below.
- The first example is of informing the User about an error in a field when he or she
  wants to add an article to the grocerylist. The field itself will also have an "X" instead of a "V" until the error is fixed.

- Error example of onhover hinting and icons

- The program will inform the User about his/her planned expenses and whether there is
  room to save some money in the chosen weekyear.

### Usage - Deleting articles
- The User can delete articles by first clicking on the row in the grocerylist and then 
  click on the button delete.

### Usage - Exporting grocerylist
- When the User is satisfied with their list he or she can export the list to .txt format.
- Per export an overview list of all supermarkets and a detailed list per supermarket will be made.
  For this example the User has chosen to only buy appelmoes at one supermarket resulting
  in an overview list with one supermarketname and a similar detailed list of the chosen supermarket.
- Again in order to prevent any copyright issues, the supermarketname has been made
  unreadable.

- Overview of expenses for the chosen weekyear date
